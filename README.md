# Backend Project
=======
# airbnb-clone-project
## Project Overview
This project is a clone of Airbnb designed to allow users to search, book, and manage accommodations online.

## Goals
- Practice full-stack development with React and Node.js
- Implement booking and listing features
- Learn database integration and user authentication

## Tech Stack
- Frontend: React, HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Backend: Node.js, Express.js
- Database: MongoDB
## Technology Stack

**Django**  
A web framework used to build the backend and RESTful APIs for the application.

**PostgreSQL**  
A relational database used to store project data securely and efficiently.

**GraphQL**  
An API query language used to fetch only the required data from the backend, reducing over-fetching.

**React**  
A frontend library used to build a dynamic and interactive user interface.

**Node.js**  
A JavaScript runtime used for server-side execution and integration with frontend technologies.

**Express.js**  
A backend framework used with Node.js to handle routing, middleware, and REST API endpoints.

**Git & GitHub**  
Version control system and hosting platform used to manage and track project code collaboratively.

## Team Roles

**Backend Developer**  
Responsible for implementing the server-side logic, building APIs, and ensuring proper integration with the database.

**Database Administrator (DBA)**  
Manages database design, optimizes queries, and ensures data integrity and security.

**Frontend Developer**  
Creates the user interface, implements design, and connects frontend with backend APIs.

**Project Manager**  
Oversees project progress, coordinates between team members, and ensures deadlines are met.

**Quality Assurance (QA) Engineer**  
Tests the application, finds bugs, and ensures the product meets quality standards.
## Feature Breakdown

**1. User Management**  
Allows users to register, log in, and manage their profiles. Users can be guests, hosts, or admins, each with specific permissions. This feature ensures secure authentication and role-based access control.

**2. Property Management**  
Hosts can add, update, and remove properties. Each property includes details like location, description, images, and amenities. This enables users to browse available accommodations easily.

**3. Booking System**  
Guests can book properties for specific dates. The system checks availability and generates a booking record. This ensures proper scheduling and prevents double bookings.

**4. Review and Rating System**  
Guests can leave reviews and ratings after their stay. Hosts can also respond to reviews. This feature helps build trust and ensures quality feedback.

**5. Payment Processing**  
Handles secure payment transactions for bookings. Supports multiple payment methods such as credit cards and PayPal. This ensures smooth financial transactions between guests and hosts.
## API Security

**1. Authentication**  
All users will authenticate via secure login, using hashed passwords and JSON Web Tokens (JWTs). Authentication ensures that only legitimate users can access their accounts.

**2. Authorization**  
Role-based access control (RBAC) will restrict users to actions allowed for their role (guest, host, admin). This prevents unauthorized access to sensitive data and operations.

**3. Rate Limiting**  
API requests will be monitored and limited to prevent abuse and denial-of-service attacks. Rate limiting ensures the system remains stable and available to all users.

**4. Data Protection**  
Sensitive data such as passwords and payment information will be encrypted both at rest and in transit. This protects user information from breaches or interception.

**5. Secure Payment Handling**  
Payments will be processed through secure payment gateways using HTTPS and tokenized transactions. This ensures financial data remains safe and prevents fraud.

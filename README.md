# Backend Project
=======
# airbnb-clone-project
## Project Overview
This project is a clone of Airbnb designed to allow users to search, book, and manage accommodations online.

## Goals
- Practice full-stack development with React and Node.js
- Implement booking and listing features
- Learn database integration and user authentication

## Tech Stack
- Frontend: React, HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Backend: Node.js, Express.js
- Database: MongoDB
## Technology Stack

**Django**  
A web framework used to build the backend and RESTful APIs for the application.

**PostgreSQL**  
A relational database used to store project data securely and efficiently.

**GraphQL**  
An API query language used to fetch only the required data from the backend, reducing over-fetching.

**React**  
A frontend library used to build a dynamic and interactive user interface.

**Node.js**  
A JavaScript runtime used for server-side execution and integration with frontend technologies.

**Express.js**  
A backend framework used with Node.js to handle routing, middleware, and REST API endpoints.

**Git & GitHub**  
Version control system and hosting platform used to manage and track project code collaboratively.

## Team Roles

**Backend Developer**  
Responsible for implementing the server-side logic, building APIs, and ensuring proper integration with the database.

**Database Administrator (DBA)**  
Manages database design, optimizes queries, and ensures data integrity and security.

**Frontend Developer**  
Creates the user interface, implements design, and connects frontend with backend APIs.

**Project Manager**  
Oversees project progress, coordinates between team members, and ensures deadlines are met.

**Quality Assurance (QA) Engineer**  
Tests the application, finds bugs, and ensures the product meets quality standards.

#Database Design
1. Identify Entities and Their Attributes
For an Airbnb-like database, the core entities are:
User
    • user_id (PK)
    • full_name
    • email
    • phone_number
    • password
    • role (guest, host, admin)
    • created_at
Property
    • property_id (PK)
    • host_id (FK → User.user_id)
    • title
    • description
    • location
    • price_per_night
    • property_type
    • status (available, booked, inactive)
    • created_at
Booking
    • booking_id (PK)
    • user_id (FK → User.user_id) → the guest who books
    • property_id (FK → Property.property_id)
    • start_date
    • end_date
    • status (pending, confirmed, cancelled)
    • total_price
Payment
    • payment_id (PK)
    • booking_id (FK → Booking.booking_id)
    • amount
    • payment_date
    • payment_method (card, PayPal, mobile money)
    • status (paid, refunded, failed)
Review
    • review_id (PK)
    • booking_id (FK → Booking.booking_id)
    • user_id (FK → User.user_id)
    • rating
    • comment
    • created_at

2. Define Relationships
    • User ↔ Property:
A User (host) can create multiple Properties.
(1-to-Many)
    • User ↔ Booking:
A User (guest) can make multiple Bookings.
(1-to-Many)
    • Property ↔ Booking:
A Property can have many Bookings over time.
(1-to-Many)
    • Booking ↔ Payment:
A Booking has one or more Payments.
(1-to-Many)
    • Booking ↔ Review:
A Booking can have one Review.
(1-to-1 or 1-to-0/1)

## Feature Breakdown
**1. User Management**  
Allows users to register, log in, and manage their profiles. Users can be guests, hosts, or admins, each with specific permissions. This feature ensures secure authentication and role-based access control.

**2. Property Management**  
Hosts can add, update, and remove properties. Each property includes details like location, description, images, and amenities. This enables users to browse available accommodations easily.

**3. Booking System**  
Guests can book properties for specific dates. The system checks availability and generates a booking record. This ensures proper scheduling and prevents double bookings.

**4. Review and Rating System**  
Guests can leave reviews and ratings after their stay. Hosts can also respond to reviews. This feature helps build trust and ensures quality feedback.

**5. Payment Processing**  
Handles secure payment transactions for bookings. Supports multiple payment methods such as credit cards and PayPal. This ensures smooth financial transactions between guests and hosts.
## API Security

**1. Authentication**  
All users will authenticate via secure login, using hashed passwords and JSON Web Tokens (JWTs). Authentication ensures that only legitimate users can access their accounts.

**2. Authorization**  
Role-based access control (RBAC) will restrict users to actions allowed for their role (guest, host, admin). This prevents unauthorized access to sensitive data and operations.

**3. Rate Limiting**  
API requests will be monitored and limited to prevent abuse and denial-of-service attacks. Rate limiting ensures the system remains stable and available to all users.

**4. Data Protection**  
Sensitive data such as passwords and payment information will be encrypted both at rest and in transit. This protects user information from breaches or interception.

**5. Secure Payment Handling**  
Payments will be processed through secure payment gateways using HTTPS and tokenized transactions. This ensures financial data remains safe and prevents fraud.
## CI/CD Pipeline

**Continuous Integration (CI)** ensures that every change to the codebase is automatically tested and integrated, preventing integration issues and improving code quality.  

**Continuous Deployment (CD)** automates the deployment process, allowing changes to be delivered to production quickly and reliably.  

**Tools:**  
- **GitHub Actions:** Automates testing, building, and deployment workflows.  
- **Docker:** Containerizes applications to ensure consistent environments across development, testing, and production.  
- **Jenkins (optional):** Can also be used to orchestrate more complex pipelines if needed.  

Implementing a CI/CD pipeline improves development efficiency, reduces manual errors, and ensures reliable releases for the project.
